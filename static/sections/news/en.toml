The school will be hosted by the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) in collaboration with CTEQ Collaboration and the Center for Frontiers in Nuclear Science (CFNS) of Stony Brook University.

The 2026 IITB-CFNS-CTEQ School on Perturbative QCD for EIC will be held 8 to 15 February 2026 at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) in Mumbai, India.

The school is ideally suited for advanced graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, with a curriculum that includes a focused introduction to perturbative quantum chromodynamics, along with applications and recent experimental results. It will also offer "hands-on" tutorial sessions on Monte Carlo event generators.

**Abstract (arXiv):**
We investigate the partonic structure of the ρ meson, the lightest spin-1 vector meson, within the light-front quark model (LFQM). To explore the sensitivity to model assumptions, we employ two distinct types of spin wave functions in the LFQM. Using light-front helicity wave functions, we derive explicit expressions for the leading-twist and subleading-twist quark parton distribution functions (PDFs), and evolve the leading-twist PDFs to higher scales with next-to-leading order (NLO) Dokshitzer--Gribov--Lipatov--Altarelli--Parisi (DGLAP) evolution. We have also calculated the Mellin moment from the evolved PDFs using a simple neural network frame and compared with available theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we compute the full set of nine leading-twist transverse-momentum-dependent distributions (TMDs) for the valence quark in the ρ meson, including three tensor TMDs that arise from spin-1 tensor polarization of the hadron. Positivity constraints for the PDFs and TMDs are examined within this framework. Our findings highlight the crucial role of tensor polarization in shaping the three-dimensional partonic structure of vector mesons.
