The school will be hosted by the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) in collaboration with CTEQ Collaboration and the Center for Frontiers in Nuclear Science (CFNS) of Stony Brook University.

The 2026 IITB-CFNS-CTEQ School on Perturbative QCD for EIC will be held 8 to 15 February 2026 at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) in Mumbai, India.

The school is ideally suited for advanced graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, with a curriculum that includes a focused introduction to perturbative quantum chromodynamics, along with applications and recent experimental results. It will also offer "hands-on" tutorial sessions on Monte Carlo event generators.
