  ### From Humble Beginnings to the World of Physics

  I am **Satyajit Puhan**, born on **15th May 1999** in a small village called **Chhatara, Srirampur, Balasore – 756029, Odisha, India**. Growing up in a simple family of farmers, I learned the true meaning of resilience and humility through life's early challenges.

  Everything changed when extraordinary teachers — **Mr. Chitta Ranjan Das, Mr. Suresh Chandra Jena, Mr. Hui Sir, and Mr. Pranesh Sahoo** — ignited a spark within me. They saw potential where I had only seen failure and gave me not just education, but direction, discipline, and purpose.

  I secured **2nd rank in Physics** in the CHSE state board exam (Odisha, 2016), qualified **JEE**, and then earned **AIR-877 in JAM (Physics)**, **AIR-1544 in GATE (Physics)**, and **AIR-209 in JEST (Physics)**.

  Today, I am a **Senior Research Fellow** at **Dr. B R Ambedkar NIT, Jalandhar**, working on **Computational High Energy Physics** under **Dr. Harleen Dahiya**. My thesis focuses on the *Tomography of Light and Heavy Mesons Using Light-front Dynamics*. I also worked as a **Visiting Fellow at JINR, Dubna, Moscow** under **Prof. Oleg V. Teryaev**, on extraction of hadron GPDs and energy-momentum tensor calculations.

  I have published **20+ papers** in leading journals including **Phys. Rev. D, JHEP, Phys. Lett. B, Nucl. Phys. A/B, PTEP, Eur. Phys. J. A/Plus**, and **Chin. Phys. C**, and presented my work internationally at **Kyoto (Japan), Zuoz (Switzerland), Dubna (Russia), TIFR (Mumbai), IIT Roorkee**, and **ICTS Bengaluru**.

  What I am today — and whatever I strive to become tomorrow — is because of the people who stood by me through every hardship.
