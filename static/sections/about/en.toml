  ### From Humble Beginnings to the World of Physics

  I am Satyajit Puhan, born on 15th May 1999 in a small village called Chhatara, Srirampur, Balasore, Odisha. Growing up in a simple family, I learned the true meaning of resilience and humility through life's early challenges.

  Everything changed when extraordinary teachers — Mr. Chitta Ranjan Das, Mr. Suresh Chandra Jena, Mr. Hui Sir, and Mr. Pranesh Sahoo — ignited a spark within me. They saw potential where I had only seen failure and gave me not just education, but direction, discipline, and purpose.

  Today, I am a Senior Research Fellow at Dr. B R Ambedkar NIT, Jalandhar, working on **Computational High Energy Physics** under Dr. Harleen Dahiya. My thesis focuses on the **Tomography of Light and Heavy Mesons Using Light-front Dynamics**. I am also a Junior Research Fellow at **JINR, Dubna, Moscow** under Prof. Oleg Teryaev, working on energy-momentum tensor for spin-0 mesons and their mechanical properties.

  What I am today — and whatever I strive to become tomorrow — is because of the people who stood by me through every hardship.
