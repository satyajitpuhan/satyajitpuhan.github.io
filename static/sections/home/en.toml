# Researcher in High Energy Physics

Senior Research Fellow at NIT Jalandhar, unraveling the quantum architecture of hadrons through light-front dynamics. With 20+ publications in Physical Review D, JHEP, and leading journals — and national ranks of **AIR-877 (JAM)** and **AIR-209 (JEST)** — I bridge first-principles QCD with observable meson structure at future colliders like the EIC and NICA.
