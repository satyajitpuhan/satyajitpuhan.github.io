            <h3 id="early-life"><span style="color: orange;">Early Life</span></h3>
<p>I am the second child of my parents, born on 15th May 1999 in a small village called Chhatara, Srirampur, located in the district of Balasore, Odisha. I am the son of Mr. Debendranath Puhan and Mrs. Durgarani Puhan, and the younger brother of Mr. Biswajit Puhan, Mr. Indrajit Puhan, and Mr. Abhijit Puhan.</p>
<p>Growing up in a poor family came with many challenges. There were countless days when we had nothing but plain rice to eat—no curry, no vegetables. Yet, those days taught us the true meaning of resilience and humility. My three brothers and I stood together through thick and thin, helping our father in the rice fields and doing whatever we could to ease the burden.</p>
<p>We lived in a small, overcrowded room of us sharing a single space. During the monsoons, rainwater would drip onto our beds, and we would place our eating plates around the room to catch the leaks. I still remember writing in notebooks made from discarded political election pamphlets and wearing torn clothes distributed by the government—just two sets to last the year.</p>
<p>It's painful to recall those days of hardship, but they are an inseparable part of who I am. That difficult childhood built in us an unshakable will to work hard and rise above our circumstances. It made us value every small achievement and never take life for granted.</p>

<p>I was not a good student during my early school years. In fact, until Class 7, I struggled a lot with my studies. I still remember the day I was caught cheating during an exam by our Head Teacher. That incident left a mark on me—not because of the punishment, but because my mother broke down in tears in front of my teacher. She wept, not out of anger, but out of worry and helplessness, seeing her son fall behind. That moment became the turning point in my life.</p>
<p>When I entered Class 8, I was so far behind that I didn’t even know the names of the days of the week. But everything began to change when I met a few extraordinary teachers—Mr. Chitta Ranjan Das, Mr. Suresh Chandra Jena, Mr. Hui Sir, and Mr. Pranesh Sahoo. They didn’t just teach me subjects—they ignited a spark within me. They saw potential where I had only seen failure. They believed in me when I didn’t believe in myself.</p>
<p>From that point forward, I started performing well in my studies. Their guidance and support became the foundation for everything I would achieve later. I owe much of who I am today to those teachers who gave me not just education, but direction, discipline, and purpose.</p>
<p>What I am today—and whatever I strive to become tomorrow—is because of the people who stood by me through every hardship. My parents, who sacrificed everything for us. My teachers, who shaped my path. And above all, my guide and inspiration—my God, Mr. Suresh Chandra Jena. His faith in me transformed my life, and I will carry his teachings and blessings with me wherever I go.</p>
