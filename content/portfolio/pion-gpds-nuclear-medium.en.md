short_description = "Valence quark GPDs of pion in isospin asymmetric nuclear matter using the light-cone quark model."
challenge = "We calculate the valence quark generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of the lightest pseudoscalar meson, pion, in an isospin asymmetric nuclear matter at zero temperature by employing a light-cone quark model. Medium modifications in the unpolarized GPDs are incorporated via the chiral SU(3) quark mean field model."
solution = "EMFFs and charge radii are calculated for vacuum and in-medium cases. Results are in agreement with available experimental data and other model predictions."
