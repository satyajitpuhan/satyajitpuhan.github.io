challenge = "We investigate the effect of the nuclear medium on the transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs) of the valence quark of pions. Using the combined approach of the chiral SU(3) quark mean field model and light-cone quark model, the in-medium leading twist TMDs f₁ and Boer-Mulders function h₁⊥ are evaluated at different baryonic densities."
solution = "This study reveals significant nuclear medium modifications on the pion TMDs, showing that both the unpolarized and Boer-Mulders functions undergo notable changes with increasing baryon density, providing insights into the QCD dynamics of pions in nuclear environments."
