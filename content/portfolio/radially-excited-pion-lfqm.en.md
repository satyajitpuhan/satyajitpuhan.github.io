short_description = "Investigation of the internal structure of ground and radially excited states of the pion within the light-front quark model."
challenge = "We investigate the internal structure of the ground (1S) and the first two radially excited (2S, 3S) states of the pion within the light-front quark model. The valence Fock sector is described using pure harmonic-oscillator eigenstates and mixed states formed as orthogonal linear combinations. Using the resulting light-front wavefunctions, we study the pion distribution amplitude, parton distribution function, and electromagnetic form factor."
solution = "The ground state DA and PDF are in good agreement with experimental data after QCD evolution. At model scale, the PDFs of 1S and 2S states show sensitivity to state mixing, while the 3S state shows pronounced sensitivity in all observables. Decay constants decrease with increasing radial excitation."
