challenge = "We investigate the impact of isospin asymmetric nuclear medium on the properties of pseudoscalar (B⁺, B⁰, Bs) and vector (B*, Bs*) B-mesons using the chiral SU(3) quark mean field model and the light-front quark model. The in-medium masses, decay constants, and distribution amplitudes are evaluated."
solution = "This study provides first predictions for B-meson properties in asymmetric nuclear matter, revealing how the nuclear environment differently affects pseudoscalar and vector B-meson channels, with relevance for future heavy-ion experiments."
