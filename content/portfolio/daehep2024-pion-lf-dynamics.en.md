challenge = "We investigate the leading twist valence quark distribution functions of pion using the light cone quark model (LCQM). We calculate the time reversal f₁(x, k²⊥) quark TMDs using the S-wave and P-wave meson state along with the PDFs. The S-wave contributes 94% while P-wave contributes only 6%."
solution = "This conference article provides insights into the pion's valence quark structure using light-front dynamics, highlighting the dominant S-wave contribution to TMDs and PDFs."
