challenge = "We have investigated the unpolarized valence quark generalized parton distribution functions (GPDs), parton distribution functions (PDFs) and parton distribution amplitudes (PDAs) for heavy spin-0 B and D-mesons in the light-front quark model (LFQM). The unpolarized GPDs at zero skewness lead to electromagnetic form factors (EMFFs) and gravitational form factors (GFFs)."
solution = "This conference proceeding presents the transverse and spatial structure of heavy B and D-mesons, extracting key observables from GPDs in the light-front framework, and discusses the complete particle structure through EMFFs and GFFs."
