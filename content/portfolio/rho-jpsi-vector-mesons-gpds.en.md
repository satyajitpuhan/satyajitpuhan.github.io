short_description = "Valence quark structure of light ρ and heavy J/ψ vector mesons using the light-cone quark model through unpolarized quark GPDs."
challenge = "We investigate the valence quark structure through chiral-even vector quark generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of light ρ and heavy J/ψ vector mesons. The charge, magnetic, and quadrupole form factors are derived from the vector quark GPDs and compared with theoretical predictions and lattice data. Structure functions for Rosenbluth scattering cross section are also calculated."
solution = "PDFs are evolved to 5 GeV² through NNLO DGLAP evolutions. Results follow similar trends to other model predictions. Form factors and structure functions are compared with NJL model predictions and lattice simulation data."
