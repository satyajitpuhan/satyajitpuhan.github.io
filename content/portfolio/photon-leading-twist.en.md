challenge = "We investigate the leading twist transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs) of the photon using light-front wave functions. The unpolarized, helicity, and transversity TMDs are computed at leading twist for the quark content of the photon, including both resolved and direct contributions."
solution = "This paper provides the first comprehensive study of leading twist TMDs for the photon using light-front techniques, contributing to the topical collection on spin-1 observables in EPJA."
