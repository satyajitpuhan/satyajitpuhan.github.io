short_description = "Leading twist valence quark TMDs and GPDs of charged kaons in isospin symmetric nuclear matter."
challenge = "We calculate the leading twist valence quark TMDs and GPDs of the charged kaons in isospin symmetric nuclear matter at zero temperature using the light-cone quark model. Medium modifications are carried out by taking inputs from the chiral SU(3) quark mean field model."
solution = "EMFFs and charge radii are calculated from unpolarized GPDs for vacuum and in-medium cases. Average transverse and longitudinal momenta variation at high baryonic density are calculated. Results are in good agreement with experimental data and other model predictions."
