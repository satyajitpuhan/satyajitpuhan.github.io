challenge = "We study the pion properties in asymmetric nuclear medium using the combined approach of chiral SU(3) quark mean field model and light-cone quark model. The in-medium PDFs, decay constants, and TMDs of pions are evaluated at finite baryon density and isospin asymmetry."
solution = "This conference article presents predictions for pion properties in asymmetric nuclear environments, demonstrating how isospin asymmetry affects the pion's internal structure."
