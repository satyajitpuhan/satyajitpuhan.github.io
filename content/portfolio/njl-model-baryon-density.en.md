challenge = "We investigate the valence quark distributions of the pion inside nuclear medium at finite baryon density using the Nambu–Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. The in-medium constituent quark mass, PDFs, and distribution amplitudes of the pion are evaluated as functions of baryon density."
solution = "This work provides an NJL model perspective on how the nuclear medium modifies the pion's quark structure, complementing studies using the light-front approach and offering predictions for medium-modified PDFs at different baryon densities."
