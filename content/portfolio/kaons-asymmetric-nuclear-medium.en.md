short_description = "Role of asymmetric nuclear medium on kaon properties using the LCQM and CQMF model."
challenge = "The role of asymmetric nuclear medium on the properties of kaon is investigated at zero and finite temperature employing a hybrid approach integrating the LCQM and chiral SU(3) quark mean field model. We analyse the impact of baryonic density, isospin asymmetry and temperature on the weak decay constant, DAs and PDFs of valence quark structure of kaons."
solution = "The effects of isospin asymmetry on kaon and antikaon doublets are studied. In-medium PDFs are evolved to Q²=16 GeV² for comparison with future experiments. Baryonic density changes produce significantly more modification than temperature and isospin asymmetry."
