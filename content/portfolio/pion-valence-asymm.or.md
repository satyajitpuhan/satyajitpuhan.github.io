challenge = "We investigate the effect of asymmetric nuclear medium at finite temperature on the valence quark distributions of pions using the combined approach of chiral SU(3) quark mean field (CQMF) model and light-cone quark model (LCQM). The in-medium PDFs, weak decay constant, and distribution amplitudes are evaluated."
solution = "This work demonstrates how the nuclear environment modifies the pion's internal structure, revealing significant medium effects on the parton distribution functions, decay constants, and distribution amplitudes of pions at finite baryon density and temperature."
