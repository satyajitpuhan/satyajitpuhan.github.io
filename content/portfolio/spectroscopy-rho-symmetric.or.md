challenge = "We investigate the behavior of the light vector ρ meson in symmetric nuclear medium at zero temperature. The mass, decay constant, leading twist distribution amplitudes, and electromagnetic form factors of the ρ-meson are computed using the light-front quark model and compared at different baryonic densities."
solution = "This work reveals appreciable nuclear medium modifications on the mass, decay constant, decay width, and distribution amplitudes of the ρ meson, while the charge radii, magnetic moment, and quadrupole moment show weaker sensitivity to changes in baryonic density."
