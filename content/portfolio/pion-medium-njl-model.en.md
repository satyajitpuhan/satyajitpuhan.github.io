short_description = "In-medium valence quark distribution of pion at finite baryon density using the light-cone quark model and NJL model."
challenge = "We calculate the in-medium valence quark distribution of the pion immersed in a finite baryon density using the light-cone quark model. To obtain the constituent quark masses at finite baryon density, we employ the two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. We focus on the in-medium electromagnetic form factor, distribution amplitude, and parton distribution function of the pion."
solution = "PDFs are evolved from model scale to perturbative scale using NLO DGLAP evolution equations. Form factors are compared with experimental measurements and lattice QCD studies. Mellin moments are compared with existing extractions and theoretical predictions."
