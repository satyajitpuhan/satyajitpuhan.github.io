short_description = "Investigation of finite density nuclear medium impact on kaon and antikaon properties using CQMF and LCQM."
challenge = "We investigated the impact of the finite density of the nuclear medium on the properties of kaons and antikaons. We employed the combined approach of chiral SU(3) quark mean field (CQMF) model and light-cone quark model (LCQM) to evaluate weak decay constant and distribution amplitudes of valence quarks."
solution = "Evaluated in-medium masses of constituent quarks using CQMF model and used those as input in LCQM to investigate medium-modified properties of K and K̄ mesons. Explored the impact of finite isospin asymmetry and temperature."
