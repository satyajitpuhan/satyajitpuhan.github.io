challenge = "We present the leading twist transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs) of the photon computed using light-front wave functions. The unpolarized and Boer-Mulders TMDs are evaluated for the resolved photon contributions."
solution = "This conference proceeding presents preliminary results on the photon TMDs, providing insights into the partonic structure of the photon within the light-front framework."
