short_description = "Spin-orbital angular momentum correlations for active quarks inside light and heavy mesons for spin-0 and spin-1 cases."
challenge = "We investigate the spin-orbital angular momentum correlations for the active quark inside light and heavy mesons for both spin-0 and spin-1 cases. These correlations are derived from GTMDs and GPDs. The dependence on longitudinal momentum fraction and transverse momentum is graphically presented."
solution = "This is the first calculation of spin-orbit correlations for light and heavy spin-1 mesons. SOCs for spin-0 pions and kaons are extended to other light and heavy mesons. Results are obtained using the overlap representation of LFWFs."
