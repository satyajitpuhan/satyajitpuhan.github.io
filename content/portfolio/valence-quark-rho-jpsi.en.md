challenge = "We investigate the valence quark distributions of light ρ and heavy J/ψ vector mesons using the light-cone quark model. The unpolarized GPDs, PDFs, and electromagnetic form factors are computed for different polarization states, along with the gravitational form factors."
solution = "This study provides a comprehensive comparison of the valence quark structure between light (ρ) and heavy (J/ψ) vector mesons, revealing how quark mass effects shape the internal distributions and form factors of spin-1 mesons."
