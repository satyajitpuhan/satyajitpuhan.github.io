challenge = "We present the spin-1 unpolarized generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of the ρ meson in the light-front formalism. The chiral-even vector quark GPDs, structure functions, and charge, magnetic, and quadrupole form factors are extracted and compared with lattice predictions."
solution = "This conference article presents the spin-1 unpolarized GPDs in the light-front framework, discussing the connection to form factors and structure functions relevant for DVCS and DVMP processes."
