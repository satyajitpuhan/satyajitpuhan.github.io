short_description = "Relations between T-even proton TMDs at all twist levels up to twist-4 using the LFQDM."
challenge = "We establish the relations between T-even proton transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs) at all twist levels up to twist-4 using the light-front quark-diquark model. For the first time, a parameterization table is presented for the derivation and recognition of proton TMDs based on their helicity."
solution = "Linear and quadratic relationships of TMDs are constructed at intra- and inter-twist levels. Inequality relations that TMDs follow are studied. Amplitude matrices are expressed as TMDs over all possible diquark helicities."
