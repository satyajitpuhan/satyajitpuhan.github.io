challenge = "We investigate the leading twist valence quark distribution functions of pion using the light cone quark model (LCQM). We calculate the time reversal f₁(x, k²⊥) quark transverse momentum parton distribution functions (TMDs) using the S-wave and P-wave meson state along with the parton distribution functions (PDFs). It is found that the S-wave contributes 94% to the TMDs and PDFs of pion, while P-wave contributes only 6%."
solution = "Computed TMDs for the pion using S-wave and P-wave states in LCQM. Calculated average transverse momentum, Mellin moment and inverse moment for valence quark of pion."
