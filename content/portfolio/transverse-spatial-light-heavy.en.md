challenge = "We investigate the unpolarized valence quark generalized parton distributions (GPDs), parton distribution functions (PDFs), and parton distribution amplitudes (PDAs) for heavy spin-0 B and D-mesons in the light-front quark model (LFQM). The electromagnetic form factors (EMFFs) and gravitational form factors (GFFs) are extracted from the GPDs at zero skewness."
solution = "This work provides a comprehensive study of the transverse and spatial distributions of mesons ranging from light pions to heavy B-mesons using the light-cone quark model, extracting key observables like form factors, charge radii, and impact parameter space distributions."
