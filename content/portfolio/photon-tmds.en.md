short_description = "T-even TMDs for the photon as a quark-antiquark Fock state using light-front wave functions."
challenge = "We calculate the photon leading-twist T-even TMDs. We treat the photon as a Fock-state of quark anti-quark pair and represent TMDs using helicity amplitudes. All 9 T-even TMDs are presented for both massless (real) and massive (virtual) photon. Only 3 TMDs are non-zero for the real photon case compared to 8 for virtual photon."
solution = "Unpolarized PDF results are in good agreement with other model predictions. Longitudinally and transversely polarized TMDs are compared for different photon masses. Spin-spin correlations between quark and photon are discussed."
