challenge = "We study the effect of the nuclear medium on the spatial distribution of pions using the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) framework. The in-medium GPDs, electromagnetic form factors, and impact parameter space distributions are evaluated using the chiral SU(3) quark mean field model and light-cone quark model."
solution = "This study reveals how the nuclear medium modifies the spatial structure of pions, showing significant changes in the GPDs, form factors, and charge radii at finite baryon density, with implications for understanding the pion structure in nuclear environments."
