challenge = "We investigate the generalized transverse momentum-dependent distributions (GTMDs) of the pion using the light-front quark model. The leading twist GTMDs, which encode the most general information about the quark structure of hadrons, are computed and their various limiting cases including TMDs, GPDs, and PDFs are examined."
solution = "This work provides a comprehensive analysis of pion GTMDs, offering a unified description of the pion's internal structure through the mother distributions that reduce to TMDs, GPDs, and form factors in appropriate limits."
