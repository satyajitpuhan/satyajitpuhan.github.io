challenge = "We compute the scalar, vector, and tensor electromagnetic form factors of the pion and kaon using the light-front quark model. The charge radii, magnetic moments, and quadrupole moments are extracted from the form factors and compared with lattice QCD and experimental data."
solution = "This work provides a unified study of all three types of electromagnetic form factors for light pseudoscalar mesons, offering predictions that serve as benchmarks for comparison with future experimental measurements at JLab and EIC."
