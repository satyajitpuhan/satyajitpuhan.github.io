short_description = "Calculation of scalar, vector, and tensor form factors for pion and kaon in the light-cone quark model."
challenge = "We calculate the possible scalar, vector, and tensor form factors (FFs) for pion and kaon in the LCQM. These FFs are calculated from the leading and sub-leading twist GPDs. The vector and tensor FFs correspond to twist-2 GPDs, whereas the scalar FFs correspond to twist-3 scalar GPDs."
solution = "FFs are found to be in agreement with experimental data, model predictions, and lattice simulation results. Charge radii are compared with other models and experimental data. The scalar radii of the pion and kaon are found to be 0.528 and 0.409 fm, respectively."
