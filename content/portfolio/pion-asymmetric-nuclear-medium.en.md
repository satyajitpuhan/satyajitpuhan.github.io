challenge = "We investigate the in-medium properties of pion in the light-front quark model, using the in-medium quark masses computed by chiral SU(3) quark mean field model. We calculate the decay constant and distribution amplitude of the pion in an asymmetric nuclear medium and derive the transition form factor for the process γ*γ → π₀."
solution = "Applied combined CQMF and LFQM approach to study pion properties in nuclear medium. Compared free space and in-medium TFF results with available experimental data."
