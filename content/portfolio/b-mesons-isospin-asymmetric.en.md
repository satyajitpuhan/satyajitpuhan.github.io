short_description = "Properties of pseudoscalar and vector B mesons under isospin asymmetric nuclear medium."
challenge = "We examine how an isospin asymmetric nuclear medium affects the properties of pseudoscalar (B⁺, B⁰) and vector (B*⁺, B*⁰) mesons under different temperature values and degrees of isospin asymmetry, using the LFQM. In-medium modifications of constituent quark masses are simulated via the chiral SU(3) quark mean field model."
solution = "Analysis focuses on effective masses, weak decay constants, and distribution amplitudes of B mesons. Vacuum values show good agreement with experimental data, validating the approach for studying medium effects."
