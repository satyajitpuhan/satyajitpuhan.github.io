short_description = "Valence quark distributions of pions in isospin asymmetric nuclear matter at zero and finite temperature."
challenge = "We calculate the valence quark distributions of pions in isospin asymmetric nuclear matter at zero and finite temperature using the LCQM. Medium modifications are incorporated through effective quark masses from the chiral SU(3) CQMF model. We focus on the impact of isospin asymmetric medium on DAs and PDFs for different baryon density and temperature values."
solution = "DAs and PDFs are evolved to Q²=10 GeV² and Q²=16 GeV² for different densities and compared with experimental data. DAs and PDFs modify substantially as a function of baryon density compared to temperature and isospin asymmetry."
