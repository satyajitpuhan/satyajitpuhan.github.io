challenge = "We study the E1 and M1 radiative transitions for the ground and radially excited charmonia states using the light-front quark model. The transition form factors and decay widths are evaluated for various charmonium states including J/ψ, ψ(2S), χ_c, and η_c."
solution = "This work provides comprehensive predictions for radiative transition properties of charmonia, extending the analysis to excited states and comparing with available experimental data and other theoretical predictions."
