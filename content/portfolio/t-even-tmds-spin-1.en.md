challenge = "We present the leading twist T-even transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs) for spin-1 heavy vector mesons (J/ψ, Υ) using the light-front quark model. The unpolarized TMD f₁, helicity TMD g₁L, and transversity TMDs h₁, h₁T⊥ are evaluated for different polarization states of the vector mesons."
solution = "This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of leading twist T-even TMDs for heavy quarkonia vector mesons, presenting three-dimensional momentum distributions and comparing the internal quark structure of J/ψ and Υ mesons."
