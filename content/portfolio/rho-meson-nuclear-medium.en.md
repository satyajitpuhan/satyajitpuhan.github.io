short_description = "Investigation of the behavior of the light vector ρ meson in the presence of a symmetric nuclear medium at zero temperature."
challenge = "We investigate the behavior of the light vector ρ meson in a symmetric nuclear medium. We calculate the mass, decay constant, leading twist distribution amplitudes (DAs), Mellin moments, decay width, and in-medium charge, magnetic, and quadrupole form factors. The charge radii, magnetic moment, and quadrupole moment are also predicted."
solution = "Found that the nuclear medium induces appreciable modifications on the mass, weak decay constant, decay width, and distribution amplitudes of the ρ meson. However, the charge radii, magnetic moment, and quadrupole moment exhibit weaker sensitivity to changes in baryonic density."
