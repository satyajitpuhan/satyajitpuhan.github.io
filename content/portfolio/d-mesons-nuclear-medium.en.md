short_description = "Properties of pseudoscalar D and vector D* mesons in isospin asymmetric nuclear medium using a hybrid LFQM + CQMF approach."
challenge = "We investigate the properties of pseudoscalar D and vector D* mesons in an isospin asymmetric nuclear medium using a hybrid approach that integrates the light-front quark model with the chiral SU(3) quark mean field model. We examine the impact of isospin asymmetry and baryon density on the effective masses, weak decay constants, and distribution amplitudes."
solution = "Results indicate significant medium-induced changes for D and D* mesons with u/d constituent quarks, while reduced effects are observed for mesons containing strange quarks. Changes in baryon density have a larger effect than temperature and isospin asymmetry."
