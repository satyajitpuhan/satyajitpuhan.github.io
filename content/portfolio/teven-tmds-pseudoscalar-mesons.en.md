This work presents a systematic computation of T-even transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs) for spin-0 pseudoscalar mesons (pion and kaon) up to twist-4 using light-front formalism. The higher-twist TMDs capture richer correlations between quarks and gluons inside these mesons.
