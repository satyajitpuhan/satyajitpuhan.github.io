short_description = "All time-reversal even TMDs for pion and kaon up to twist-4 in the light-front holographic and quark models."
challenge = "We investigate the pseudo-scalar meson structure via TMDs in the light-front holographic model and quark model. Starting from leading order, we calculate all T-even TMDs for pion and kaon up to twist-4. The 3D and 2D structures with average quark transverse momenta are shown. PDFs are compared with E615 experimental results."
solution = "Sum rules, TMD transverse dependence, inverse moments and Gaussian transverse dependence ratio are studied. Transverse quark densities are analyzed in momentum space. Higher twist kaon properties in the light-front framework are predicted for the first time."
