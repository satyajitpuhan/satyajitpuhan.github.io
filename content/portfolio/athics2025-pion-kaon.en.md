challenge = "We investigate the leading-twist transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs) of the pion and kaon using the power law light-front wave functions. The unpolarized TMD f₁ and Boer-Mulders function h₁⊥ are computed and compared."
solution = "This conference proceeding presents leading-twist TMD predictions for light mesons using power-law wave function parametrizations, facilitating comparisons with other model approaches."
