challenge = "We present the leading twist quark TMDs for the spin-1 heavy vector mesons J/ψ and Υ using the overlap of light-front wave functions. We compute TMDs in the LFHM and LFQM and compare with the Bethe-Salpeter model. The k⊥ moments of the quark are calculated in both models."
solution = "LFQM predictions are in accord with the BSE model. Leading twist PDFs are analyzed and found to agree with BLFQ and BSE model predictions."
