This work presents a detailed investigation of the valence quark structure of the pion through Generalized Transverse Momentum-Dependent Parton Distributions (GTMDs). The study uses the light-front quark model to compute these distributions, providing crucial inputs for the physics program at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).
