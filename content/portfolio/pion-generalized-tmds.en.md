short_description = "Internal structure of the pion using generalized transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions (GTMDs) within the LCQM."
challenge = "We investigate the internal structure of the pion using GTMDs within the light-cone quark model. By solving the quark-quark correlator, we derive twist-2, 3, and 4 quark GTMDs in terms of light-front wave functions. Out of 16 possible GTMDs, 12 are found to be nonzero. We extract TMDs, GPDs, FFs and PDFs up to twist-4."
solution = "The elastic charge radius of the pion is determined to be 0.558 fm. Results exhibit qualitative agreement with NJL model, Light-front holographic model, and spectator model predictions at leading twist. Provides comprehensive insight into pion internal structure."
