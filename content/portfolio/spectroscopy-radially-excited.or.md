challenge = "We study the spectroscopy of radially excited charmonia (ψ(2S), ψ(3770)) and bottomonia (Υ(2S), Υ(3S)) states using the light-front quark model. Mass spectra, decay constants, and distribution amplitudes are computed for the ground and excited states."
solution = "This work extends the light-front quark model to treat radially excited heavy quarkonia, providing predictions for mass spectra, decay properties, and distribution amplitudes that can be compared with lattice QCD and experimental measurements."
