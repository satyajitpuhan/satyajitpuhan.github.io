short_description = "Valence quark TMDs of pions in isospin asymmetric nuclear matter using the light-cone quark model."
challenge = "We calculate the valence quark transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs) of pions in isospin asymmetric nuclear matter at zero temperature using the light-cone quark model. Medium modifications in the pion unpolarized TMDs are induced through the effective quark masses from the chiral SU(3) CQMF model."
solution = "Spin densities at different momentum fraction (x) are calculated at different baryonic densities. This work provides important insights into the nuclear medium effects on the pion transverse structure."
