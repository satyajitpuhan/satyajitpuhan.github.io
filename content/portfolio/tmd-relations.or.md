challenge = "We study the relations between transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs) using a light-front quark-diquark model. The interrelations among leading twist TMDs are examined and tested analytically."
solution = "This work provides a systematic exploration of TMD relations predicted by model-independent considerations and tests their validity within the light-front quark-diquark model framework, offering insights into the universality and structure of TMD correlations."
