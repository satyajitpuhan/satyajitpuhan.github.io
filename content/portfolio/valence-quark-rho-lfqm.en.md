challenge = "We investigate the valence quark structure of the ρ meson using the light-front quark model. The T-even TMDs, GPDs, and PDFs are computed for different polarization configurations of the ρ meson, along with the electromagnetic and gravitational form factors."
solution = "This comprehensive study reveals the rich internal structure of the ρ meson, providing predictions for its TMDs, GPDs, and form factors that can guide future experimental measurements of vector meson structure."
