challenge = "We investigate the spectroscopy of radially excited D-mesons using the light-front quark model. The mass spectra, decay constants, and distribution amplitudes are computed for both ground and excited D-meson states."
solution = "This conference article provides predictions for the spectroscopic properties of excited D-mesons, extending the LFQM analysis to the open-charm sector."
