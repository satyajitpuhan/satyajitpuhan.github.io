challenge = "We investigate the quark spin-orbit correlations in both spin-0 (π, K) and spin-1 (ρ, K*, J/ψ) mesons using the light-front quark model. The Wigner distributions and orbital angular momentum (OAM) contributions are computed for different quark polarization configurations."
solution = "This work reveals the spin-orbit correlation patterns in mesons of different spin states, quantifying the quark orbital angular momentum and its coupling with spin in the light-front framework. Comparisons with other theoretical predictions are provided."
