short_description = "Transverse and spatial structure of light (π⁺, K⁺) and heavy (ηc, ηb, B, D) pseudoscalar mesons in the LCQM."
challenge = "We investigate the transverse and spatial structure of light and heavy pseudoscalar mesons using the LCQM. The leading twist unpolarized TMD is solved using the quark-quark correlator. We also compute the leading twist unpolarized GPD. EMFFs and GFFs are derived by taking zeroth and first moments of the unpolarized GPD."
solution = "Average momenta carried by quark and antiquark are predicted. EMFFs are compatible with available lattice simulation results. PDFs are calculated for both quarks and antiquarks, and the PDF sum rule is verified."
