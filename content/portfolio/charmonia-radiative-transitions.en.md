short_description = "Physical properties of ground and radially excited charmonia states in the light-front quark model."
challenge = "We investigate the physical properties like decay constants, radiative transitions, decay widths, and branching ratios for the ground and radially excited charmonia states. We study χc0→J/ψ+γ and ψ(2S)→χc0+γ, hc(1P)→ηc(1S)+γ, and ηc(2S)→hc(1P)+γ transitions."
solution = "Transition form factors are calculated and used to derive decay widths and branching ratios. Results are in good agreement with available experimental, theoretical and lattice simulation data."
