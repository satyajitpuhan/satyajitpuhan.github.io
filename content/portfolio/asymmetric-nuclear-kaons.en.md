challenge = "We investigate the effect of an asymmetric nuclear medium on the valence quark structure of kaons and antikaons. Using the chiral SU(3) quark mean field model combined with the light-cone quark model, we compute the in-medium PDFs, decay constants, and distribution amplitudes for K and K̄ mesons at finite baryon density and isospin asymmetry."
solution = "This work provides insights into how asymmetric nuclear matter modifies the internal structure of kaons, demonstrating significant differences between kaon and antikaon distributions and their sensitivity to the nuclear environment."
