challenge = "We study the distribution functions of the radially excited pion (π(1300)) using the light-front quark model. The PDFs, distribution amplitudes, electromagnetic form factors, and charge radii are computed for both the ground state and radially excited pion."
solution = "This work provides first predictions for the internal structure of the radially excited pion using the LFQM, revealing significant differences from the ground state pion in the distribution functions and form factors."
