challenge = "We investigate the ground state (1S), radially excited states (2S, 3S), and orbitally excited state (1P) for heavy charmonia and bottomonia mesons in the LFQM. We calculate EMFFs, charge radii, decay constants, PDFs, and DAs for the quarkonia system."
solution = "The 3S and 1P excited states are rarely investigated; this study provides novel results for these states. 3D wave functions for radially excited states are illustrated to study nodal structures."
