challenge = "We study the properties of D and D* mesons in isospin asymmetric nuclear medium using the combined approach of chiral SU(3) quark mean field model and light-cone quark model. The in-medium masses, decay constants, and distribution amplitudes are computed at finite baryon density and isospin asymmetry."
solution = "This work reveals how the isospin asymmetric nuclear environment modifies the properties of open-charm D and D* mesons, providing predictions relevant for heavy-ion collision experiments at FAIR and NICA."
