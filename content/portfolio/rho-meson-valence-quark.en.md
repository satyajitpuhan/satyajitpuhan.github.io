short_description = "Partonic structure of the ρ meson within the LFQM using two distinct spin wave functions."
challenge = "We investigate the partonic structure of the ρ meson, the lightest spin-1 vector meson, within the light-front quark model (LFQM). Using light-front helicity wave functions, we derive explicit expressions for the leading-twist and subleading-twist quark PDFs, and evolve them with NLO DGLAP evolution. We compute the full set of nine leading-twist TMDs including three tensor TMDs arising from spin-1 tensor polarization."
solution = "Mellin moments are calculated from evolved PDFs using a simple neural network frame. Positivity constraints for PDFs and TMDs are examined. Findings highlight the crucial role of tensor polarization in shaping the 3D partonic structure of vector mesons."
