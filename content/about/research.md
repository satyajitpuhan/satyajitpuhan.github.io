### Early Life
I am the second child of my parents, born on 15th May 1999 in a small village called Chhatara, Srirampur, located in the district of Balasore, Odisha. I am the son of Mr. Debendranath Puhan and Mrs. Durgarani Puhan, and the younger brother of Mr. Biswajit Puhan, Mr. Indrajit Puhan, and Mr. Abhijit Puhan.

Growing up in a poor family came with many challenges. There were countless days when we had nothing but plain rice to eat—no curry, no vegetables. Yet, those days taught us the true meaning of resilience and humility. My three brothers and I stood together through thick and thin, helping our father in the rice fields and doing whatever we could to ease the burden.

We lived in a small, overcrowded room of us sharing a single space. During the monsoons, rainwater would drip onto our beds, and we would place our eating plates around the room to catch the leaks. I still remember writing in notebooks made from discarded political election pamphlets and wearing torn clothes distributed by the government—just two sets to last the year.

It's painful to recall those days of hardship, but they are an inseparable part of who I am. That difficult childhood built in us an unshakable will to work hard and rise above our circumstances. It made us value every small achievement and never take life for granted.
