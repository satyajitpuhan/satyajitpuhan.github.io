<strong><span style="color: teal;">Abstract</span>:</strong> 
    In this talk, I discuss the internal structure of light mesons such as the pion, kaon, and rho using light-front models. The study focuses on valence quark-level Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs), Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs), and Transverse Momentum Dependent distributions (TMDs). Additionally, I highlight the mechanical properties of the pion and explore how these distributions behave in a nuclear medium.

<strong><span style="color: teal;">Abstract</span>:</strong> 
    The talk focuses on studying the internal structure of pion, kaon, and ρ mesons within light-front models. The authors systematically explore transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs), generalised parton distributions (GPDs), form factors (FFs), and parton distribution functions (PDFs) for these particles. Additionally, the authors delve into the mechanical properties of the pion and kaon by calculating pressure and shear distributions through GPDs. The charge radii of these particles are predicted as well, providing insight into their spatial structure. To further understand the behaviour of the pion and kaon in nuclear environments, these distributions are studied in medium using the chiral SU(3) quark mean field model. In addition, the PDFs are evolved to higher Q2 scales to facilitate comparison with experimental data. The upcoming Electron-Ion Collider and NICA will serve as a crucial platform to test and refine these theoretical predictions, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the internal dynamics of these mesons.

<strong><span style="color: teal;">Abstract</span>:</strong> 
    Pion and kaon are one of the simplest meson structures to study the distribution function. In this
work, we have calculated the time reversal quark transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs) in the light-front based holographic model (LFHM) and quark model (LFQM)
up to twist-4. We have presented the three dimensional structure of T-even TMDs for both the particles in both models. The transverse structure have been discussed with the help of two dimensional
contour plot distribution in momentum space and average quark momenta in both the models. We
have taken the overlap representation of LFHM wave function for orbital angular momentum Lz = 0
and Lz = 1, which makes the calculations more significant. The T-even TMDs have also been compared for both the models and evolved to higher Q2 to compare with available TMDs extraction datafor the case of pion. The collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs) have also been investigated in this work. The unpolarized f1(x) PDF have been evolved through DGLAP evolution from Q2 = 1 GeV2 to 16 GeV2 and found significant behavior with experimental results. The inverse moments and Mellin moments have also been discussed in this work. The average longitudinal momentum fraction < x > and transverse momenta < k2⊥ > of our calculation found to be consistent with other model result. The spatial structure have also been studied through leading twist GPDs for both the particles in LFQM and have been implicated to understand the form factors (FFs). The FFs found to be consistent with lattice result and experimental result. We have also tried to study the medium modification
effect on PDFs in asymmetric matter.
