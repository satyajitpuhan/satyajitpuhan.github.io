  <strong><span style="color: teal;">Abstract</span>:</strong> 
  In this talk, I am going to discuss the internal structure of pion, kaon, and rho mesons using the light-front models. These internal structures have been studied using the valence quark TMDs, GPDs, and PDFs. I will also talk about the mechanical properties of pions and the behavior of these distribution functions in the presence of a nuclear medium.
