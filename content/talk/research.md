<strong><span style="color: teal;">Abstract</span>:</strong> 
    In this talk, I discuss the internal structure of light mesons such as the pion, kaon, and rho using light-front models. The study focuses on valence quark-level Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs), Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs), and Transverse Momentum Dependent distributions (TMDs). Additionally, I highlight the mechanical properties of the pion and explore how these distributions behave in a nuclear medium.

<strong><span style="color: teal;">Abstract</span>:</strong> 
    The talk focuses on studying the internal structure of pion, kaon, and ρ mesons within light-front models. The authors systematically explore transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs), generalised parton distributions (GPDs), form factors (FFs), and parton distribution functions (PDFs) for these particles. Additionally, the authors delve into the mechanical properties of the pion and kaon by calculating pressure and shear distributions through GPDs. The charge radii of these particles are predicted as well, providing insight into their spatial structure. To further understand the behaviour of the pion and kaon in nuclear environments, these distributions are studied in medium using the chiral SU(3) quark mean field model. In addition, the PDFs are evolved to higher Q2 scales to facilitate comparison with experimental data. The upcoming Electron-Ion Collider and NICA will serve as a crucial platform to test and refine these theoretical predictions, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the internal dynamics of these mesons.
