### <span style="color: orange;">What I do !!</span>

Hi, I'm Satya! I'm currently working as a Senior Research Fellow, deeply immersed in the theoretical exploration of hadronic physics. My work revolves around uncovering the fundamental structure and internal dynamics of mesons and baryons — the particles that make up most of the visible matter in the universe. I study Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs), Transverse Momentum Dependent distributions (TMDs), Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs), GTMDs, and form factors using techniques rooted in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and light-front dynamics.
I also design and implement computational tools, primarily in Python and Mathematica, to model and simulate complex physical systems, ranging from simple two-body bound states to higher Fock-state contributions. This is not just a job for me — this is my way of contributing to a deeper understanding of the universe.

### <span style="color: orange;">Why I do !!</span>

Because I'm endlessly curious about how matter is built and how the invisible structure beneath hadrons shapes the world around us. What started as a fascination with equations and quantum mechanics evolved into a mission — to explore the internal landscapes of protons, neutrons, and mesons.
I believe that fundamental physics not only answers "how" but also "why" questions — why particles have mass, why confinement exists, and why the universe behaves the way it does. Every layer I peel back from hadronic structure brings me closer to these deeper truths.
And more than anything, I do it for the thrill of chasing the unknown — solving puzzles that no one else has cracked yet.

### <span style="color: orange;">How I Do !!</span>

I combine analytical techniques with computational simulations, working extensively with light-front quantization, effective models like the Nambu–Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model, and Light-Front Quark Models (LFQM). I use mathematical tools to derive theoretical expressions for observables like form factors, pressure distributions, and spin-orbit correlations, and then simulate these using symbolic programming in Mathematica or numerical routines in Python.
My methodology is collaborative and data-informed — I frequently compare my model results with experimental data and lattice QCD simulations, refining parameters and extending models as needed.
Whether it's constructing helicity amplitude matrices for spin-1 hadrons, or extracting TMDs from correlators, my work is rigorous, step-by-step, and always guided by physical insight.
