## About This Talk

I presented my research on identifying the internal structure of the pion using three complementary types of distribution functions: Transverse Momentum Dependent distributions (TMDs), Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs), and Generalized Distribution Amplitudes (GDAs).

This talk was part of the program at the **International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS-TIFR)**, Bengaluru, India.
