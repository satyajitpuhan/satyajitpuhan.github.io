## Abstract

Pion and kaon are one of the simplest meson structures to study the distribution function. In this work, we have calculated the time reversal quark transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs) in the light-front based holographic model (LFHM) and quark model (LFQM) up to twist-4.

We have presented the three dimensional structure of T-even TMDs for both the particles in both models. The transverse structure have been discussed with the help of two dimensional contour plot distribution in momentum space and average quark momenta in both the models. The T-even TMDs have also been compared for both the models and evolved to higher Q² to compare with available TMDs extraction data for the case of pion.

The collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs) have also been investigated. The unpolarized f₁(x) PDF have been evolved through DGLAP evolution from Q² = 1 GeV² to 16 GeV² and found significant behavior with experimental results. The spatial structure have also been studied through leading twist GPDs and have been implicated to understand the form factors (FFs).
