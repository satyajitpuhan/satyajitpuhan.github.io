**Poster Title:** Internal Structure of Heavy B and D-mesons

**Venue:** [HQL 2023 Conference](https://www.tifr.res.in/~hql2023/), TIFR, Mumbai, India

**Mode:** In person

I presented a poster on the unpolarized valence quark GPDs and PDFs for heavy spin-0 B- and D-mesons using the light-front quark model.

PDFs were extracted from the unpolarized f₁(x, k²⊥) transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs). We solved the quark-quark correlation function for unpolarized H(x, ζ, t) GPDs. The electromagnetic form factors (EMFFs) and gravitational form factors (GFFs) were derived from the unpolarized GPDs at zero skewness.
