**Talk Title:** Spin-1 unpolarized GPDs in Light-front formalism

**Venue:** [68th DAE Symposium on Nuclear Physics (SNP 2024)](https://sympnp.org/snp2025/), IIT Roorkee, India

**Mode:** In person

I presented our work on the spin-1 unpolarized generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in the light-front formalism. The talk covered the chiral-even vector quark GPDs of the ρ meson derived using the light-cone quark model, along with the structure functions corresponding to the Rosenbluth scattering cross section.

The charge, magnetic, and quadrupole form factors were extracted from the vector quark GPDs and compared with theoretical predictions and lattice simulation results. We also discussed the parton distribution functions obtained in the forward limit of GPDs, evolved through NNLO DGLAP evolution.
