## About This Talk

I presented my recent work on extracting the gravitational form factors (GFFs) of the pion and discussed approaches for their experimental extraction. This talk was part of the "Interplay of gravity and strong interactions" program at the **Bogoliubov Laboratory of Theoretical Physics (BLTP)**, Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), Dubna, Moscow.
