## Abstract

The talk focuses on studying the internal structure of pion, kaon, and ρ mesons within light-front models. We systematically explore transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs), generalised parton distributions (GPDs), form factors (FFs), and parton distribution functions (PDFs) for these particles.

Additionally, the mechanical properties of the pion and kaon are investigated by calculating pressure and shear distributions through GPDs. The charge radii of these particles are predicted as well, providing insight into their spatial structure.

To further understand the behaviour of the pion and kaon in nuclear environments, these distributions are studied in medium using the chiral SU(3) quark mean field model. The PDFs are evolved to higher Q² scales to facilitate comparison with experimental data.

The upcoming **Electron-Ion Collider** and **NICA** will serve as crucial platforms to test and refine these theoretical predictions.
